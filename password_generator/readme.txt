This Python script generates a random 8-character password containing:

-2 uppercase letters (A-Z)
-2 lowercase letters (a-z)
-2 digits (0-9)
-2 special characters (chosen from common punctuation marks)

It ensures randomness using random.randint() for letters 
and digits and random.choice() for punctuation. 
The password is then printed as a string.
